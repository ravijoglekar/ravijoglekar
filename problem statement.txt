Problem Statement:

In an MXN matrix, there are elements either set to zero(0) or one(1).
Adjucent 1's only horizontal and vertical are considered as a single cluster seperated by zeros.
find the number of clusters in a matrix.

Example:
Rows = 4, Columns = 4.
Matrix elements:
1 1 0 1
1 0 1 1
0 0 1 0
1 0 0 1

The number of clusters are: 4

Below are the clusters:
1 1       1       1       1
1       1 1
        1
        
Input of the program: 
1. Accept the number of rows and columns from the user.
2. accept the elements of the matrix
3. Print/return the number of clusters
