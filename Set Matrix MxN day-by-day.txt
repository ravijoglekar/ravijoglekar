Problem Statement:

In an MXN matrix, there are elements either set to zero(0) or one(1).
Every day all zeros will be set to 1 if immediate adjucent element from top, left, right or bottom is already set to 1.
Find number of days needed to set all elements to 1.

Rows = 4, Columns = 4.
Matrix elements:
1 0 0 1
1 0 0 1
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0

The number days needed are: 2

Day 1:
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
1 0 1 1
1 1 1 1 

Day 2:
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
        
Input of the program: 
1. Accept the number of rows and columns from the user.
2. accept the elements of the matrix
3. Print/return the number of days
